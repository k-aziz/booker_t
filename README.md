# Booker T

I failed my driving test one too many times! As a result I wrote this little webscraper to poll the DVLA website and notify me by text of the next earliest possible booking. Since tests were cancelled often, this helped get earlier dates immediately as they became available.

It was useful I promise, that one time.
